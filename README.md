# Swift SVG Library Comparison

This repository is meant to test performance and usage of currently available SVG libraries in Swift.

## How to run

- Install [Carthage](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage) in your machine, and run `carthage bootstrap --cache-builds`.
- Open the `SVGPlayground.xcodeproj` in Xcode 9 or higher.
- Run the project in one of your simulator!

## List of compared libraries

- [Macaw](https://github.com/exyte/Macaw)
- [SwiftSVG](https://github.com/mchoe/SwiftSVG)

I'm planning to compare SVGKit too, but it fails upon Carthage installation.
